PerfektBlue is a framework for automotive security assessment, providing a guided, multi-stage process to probe, exploit, and interact with vehicle infotainment and control systems via Bluetooth and CAN bus.

## Attack Workflow

PerfektBlue follows a systematic methodology to assess and exploit target systems. Understanding this workflow is key to using the tool effectively.

### Stage 1: Reconnaissance & Fingerprinting

The first step is to gather intelligence about the target.

*   **Bluetooth Scan:** The tool begins by performing a Bluetooth service scan (`sdptool`) on the provided MAC address. This identifies open profiles and services. The primary goal is to find the **AVRCP (Audio/Video Remote Control Profile)** service, which is the entry point for the initial exploit.
*   **Nmap Scan (Optional):** If a target IP address is provided, `nmap` is used to perform OS and service fingerprinting. This can reveal the underlying operating system and other running services, which helps in selecting the correct shellcode architecture.

### Stage 2: Exploitation

This stage focuses on gaining initial access to the system.

1.  **AVRCP Information Leak:** PerfektBlue sends a specially crafted, malformed AVRCP command to the target. In vulnerable systems, this can cause the service to crash or respond incorrectly, leaking a small amount of memory from the stack or heap. This leaked data may contain a memory address.
2.  **Shellcode Generation:** Using the information from the fingerprinting stage, `msfvenom` is used to generate a reverse shell payload for the appropriate architecture (e.g., ARM, x86). The payload is configured to connect back to the attacker's IP address.
3.  **Heap Overflow:** The tool constructs a payload that combines a buffer of junk data, the leaked memory address (if obtained), and the `msfvenom` shellcode. This payload is sent to the target, attempting to overwrite the program's execution flow and force it to run the shellcode.

### Stage 3: Post-Exploitation

Once the shellcode is executed, this stage manages the connection.

*   **Reverse Shell Listener:** The framework starts a listener on the specified port. If the exploit was successful, the target system will connect back, providing an interactive command shell. From here, the attacker can explore the compromised system.

### Stage 4: CAN Bus Analysis

If a shell is obtained or if the vehicle's network is otherwise accessible, PerfektBlue can interact with the CAN bus.

*   **CAN Fuzzing:** Sends a stream of random CAN messages to the specified interface. This can be used to discover unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in various Electronic Control Units (ECUs).
*   **CAN Mapping & Replay:** The tool can listen for and record CAN messages, saving them to a database. This allows for the mapping of commands (e.g., discovering the command to unlock doors). These mapped commands can then be replayed.

## Installation

For Debian-based systems like Kali Linux and Parrot OS, you can install PerfektBlue using the provided `.deb` package.

1.  **Download** the latest `perfektblue.deb` from the releases page.
2.  **Install** the package using `apt`:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ./perfektblue.deb
    ```
    This will automatically install all required dependencies, including `metasploit-framework`.

## Usage

1.  **Launch** the application from your terminal or application menu:
    ```bash
    sudo perfektblue
    ```
2.  **Follow the on-screen prompts** to proceed through the attack workflow. The tool will guide you from fingerprinting to exploitation and beyond.
